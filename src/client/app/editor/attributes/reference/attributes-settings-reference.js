There are two options for tonemapping.<br />Linear: imply scales HDR colors by exposure.<br />Filmic: More sophisticated curve, good at softening overly bright spots, while preserving dark shades as well.<br /><br />Linear tonemapping is active by default, it\'s simply (color * exposure). You can tweak exposure to make quick changes to brightness. Note that it\'s not just simple brightness Ã  la Photoshop because your input can be HDR. e.g. If you have a light source with intensity = 8, it will still be quite bright (4) after exposure = 0.5. So, all visible things won\'t just fade out linearly.<br /><br />Filmic tonemapping is a good choice in high-contrast environments, like scenes lit by bright Sun, or interiors with bright lights being close to walls/ceiling. It will nicely remap out-of-range super bright values to something more perceptually realistic (our eyes and film do tonemapping as well, we don\'t see physically linear values). Well, ask any photographer: nobody likes to leave extremely bright spots as well as pitch black spots on a photo. Filmic tonemapping gives you nice abilities to get rid of such spots.',
