They typically have two uses:<br /><br />A cube map can define your scene\'s sky box. A sky box contains imagery of the distant visuals of your scene such as hills, mountains, the sky and so on.<br /><br />A cube map can add reflections to any material. Imagine a shiny, chrome ball bearing in your scene. The ball reflects the surrounding scene. For open environments, you would normally set the scene\'s sky box cube map as the cube map on a reflective object\'s materials.',
